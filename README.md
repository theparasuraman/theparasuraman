👋 Hey there, I'm theparasuraman

💻 Software Developer | Streaming Engineer | Playout Engineer | AI & Embedded Developer | Linux Enthusiast
🔧 Open Source Contributor | IPTV Broadcast Specialist

I build low-latency IPTV pipelines, real-time playout systems, AI-based detection setups, and embedded digital signage solutions.
My experience spans capture hardware, protocol engineering, FFmpeg internals, AI model training, and custom analytics engines for channel health.
I enjoy solving problems where streaming, AI, and embedded systems intersect.

• Integrated capture hardware: Deltacast, AJA, DekTec, Blackmagic DeckLink
• Built AI-driven edge camera detection pipelines for PT-based models
• Delivered digital signage with Genio for smart content playback
• Optimized HLS/RTMP/SRT/UDP pipelines with FFmpeg tuning
• Automated broadcast/IPTV operations with Bash + Python + Git hooks
• Deployed backend systems using Apache, Tomcat, Nginx, and Docker
